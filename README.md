# tableau_challenge
EDIT [9:00am]: I discovered the workbook was not updated with analysis and other visuals, directory is now final.

My name is Sean Weeks, this is my submission repository for the Module 18 Challenge

This respository was made due to complications regarding Tableau Public upload, I decided to upload my related files to github for submission. Files such as my main Tableau workbook in TWBX, the Resources folder contains my CSV file (data source), and other related data files within Data/Tableau Temp.

Within the main Tableau workbook, contains between 4-10 total visualizations, a map (additionally two duplicates of the map set to different filters used for the story), dashboards, story, and analysis.

-[simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-zips), used their US zip codes database to convert longitude and latitude values to zip codes via Python.

-XPert Learning Assistant, used to review and double-check the code as needed.
