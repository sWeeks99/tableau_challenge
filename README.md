# tableau_challenge

My name is Sean Weeks, this is my submission repository for the Module 18 Challenge

This respository was made due to complications regarding Tableau Public upload, I decided to upload my related files to github for submission. Files such as my workbook in TWB and TPW, the Resources folder contains my CSV file, my data source for the assignment.

Within the main Tableau workbook, contains between 4-10 total visualizations, a map (additionally two duplicates of the map set to different filters used for the story), dashboards, story, and analysis.

-[simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-zips), used their US zip codes database to convert longitude and latitude values to zip codes via Python.

-XPert Learning Assistant, used to review and double-check the code as needed.
